# Chatbot-Development

🤖 AI Chatbot using LangChain, OpenAI API, and Ollama
This project is a smart and extensible AI chatbot built using LangChain, integrated with OpenAI's powerful language models and Ollama, enabling seamless conversational experiences. It showcases how to combine large language models with custom tools, prompts, and memory for interactive chatbot development.

📌 Overview
This AI chatbot:

Uses LangChain as the orchestration framework

Leverages OpenAI API (e.g., GPT-4) for powerful language understanding and generation

Integrates Ollama for efficient local model handling and token streaming

Supports memory, retrieval, and tool use for contextual and dynamic conversations

🔧 Features
🌐 Conversational Memory: Remembers prior messages for coherent multi-turn interactions

📚 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Optionally enhanced with external knowledge or documents

🔌 Tool Integration: Can be extended to use custom tools, functions, or APIs

🧠 Multi-model Support: Works with both OpenAI-hosted and locally-run models via Ollama

💬 Streaming Support: Real-time response streaming for better user experience

⚙️ Tech Stack
LangChain

OpenAI API (GPT-3.5/GPT-4)

Ollama (for running local LLMs like LLaMA, Mistral, etc.)

Python 3.10+

Optional: Streamlit or Flask for frontend interface
